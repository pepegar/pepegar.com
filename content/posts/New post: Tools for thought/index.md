For quite some time I’ve been searching for the best tool for supporting my studying. I’m a programmer, and am interested in quite a lot of different subjects, ranging from programming languages, distributed systems, machine learning, big data, etc.

There is an awful number of concepts in all these fields that I’d like to retain if I want to keep studying and advancing on these fields, and I’ve tried a lot of different approaches:

## Notion

Notion is an awesome tool. Its interface is easy to use, the app works on all possible devices, and it feels just nice. The big drawback I find to it is that it does too much for me. Maybe I haven’t learned it correctly, or I haven’t spent enough time working on my setup, but I’ve found that it’s just too big for me.

## Roam research

I discovered the Zettelkasten method thanks to Roam research. I’m no expert in it, but people ensure they can supercharge their brain using it, by asking questions to your _zettelkasten_ and being able to discover links between ideas stored in it. It’s based on so called _heterarchies_ that form in the information organically through links and backlinks.

Roam research is a SAAS application that applies this method, and it’s a great tool

## Org roam

org-roam{{% sidenote %}}<https://www.orgroam.com/>{{% /sidenote %}} is the Emacs based alternative for Roam. It’s an awesome Emacs extension, opensource, and delightly crafted. Here you can see how it integrates with other emacs based tools, such as org-bibtex.

## Neuron

Neuron is a standalone Zettelkasten implementation. It features also a static site generator to convert all your markdown based notes into beautiful websites. 

## Muse

Muse is an iPad app with a $100 price tag per year, I bought it and tried it for a few months, but don't use it anymore because you need to be in iOS devices to use it, and my daily driver is a beefy Linux server.

# Conclusion

As much as I love Emacs and the Org ecosystem, I'm nowadays using Neuron more and more. It's a much simpler implementation, you're not tied to org mode, but simple Markdown files, and the website generation is flawless.

Also, @srid has created this app, <cerveau.app> to be able to update your neuron based zettelkasten from the web directly, and the pricing is reasonable!

For quite some time I’ve been searching for the best tool for supporting my studying. I’m a programmer, and am interested in quite a lot of different subjects, ranging from programming languages, distributed systems, machine learning, big data, etc.

There is an awful number of concepts in all these fields that I’d like to retain if I want to keep studying and advancing on these fields, and I’ve tried a lot of different approaches:

## Notion

Notion is an awesome tool. Its interface is easy to use, the app works on all possible devices, and it feels just nice. The big drawback I find to it is that it does too much for me. Maybe I haven’t learned it correctly, or I haven’t spent enough time working on my setup, but I’ve found that it’s just too big for me.

## Roam research

I discovered the Zettelkasten method thanks to Roam research. 

## Org roam

## Neuron

## Muse

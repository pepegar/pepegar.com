title: 1. Introduction
---

This course is[^1] for people that know a little bit of Python already, but want to
dig deeper into some more advanced tools and techniques used in Python
nowadays.

It is biased towards simplicity & ease of use.  I've selected some tools
instead of others like FastAPI[^fastapi] and UV[^uv] because they make learning
some aspects of modern Python easier.


## Why the course?

I'm a professor, I teach at IE School of Science and Technology[^hst], and I
have a course in which i go through the materials of the course for students of
a Masters in Computer Science.  However, I like the materials beign freely
available.

## What's in the course?

The course is called Advanced Python, but one could also call it _Modern
Python_.  In it I'll cover some newer tools and techniques that the Python
community uses nowadays.  Things like Dataclasses, async programming, modern
dev tools, etc.  It's not intended to be a one-stop-shop, but to spark interest
in how things can be done nowadays with modern language features and tools.

In the course, you'll obviously see a lot of code, and i'll assume you can go
through it.  Please go to Python for Everybody[^py4e] if you don't understand
something from the next block:

```python !python example.py
class Person():
    def __init__(self, name, title):
        self.name = name
        self.title = title

    def salutation(self):
        return f"{self.title}. {self.name}"


people = [
    Person("Pepe", "Mr"),
    Person("Giulia", "Ms")
]

[print(person.salutation()) for person in people]

i = 0

while i < len(people):
    if people[i].title == "Mr":
        print(f"Hello Mr. {people[i].name}")
    i += 1
```

## TODO: find a way of listing content in Hugo and show the all the contents in the course


[^py4e]: <https://py4e.com>. Thankfully, there's a lot of resources for
    learning python nowadays, but I really like the style and way of teaching
    of Py4e.  Also, it has exercises at the end of chapters that can help students.
